## Description

This course focuses on the use of frameworks in server-side web
programming. Students will also be introduced to the use of third-party
libraries, automation tools, and database abstraction layers.

## Role in the Program

The *Web Framework* course (582-41B) is part of the Programming (P)
field of competencies. As the program's last course dedicated to
server-side programming, it allows student to integrate all the
knowledge acquired throughout the previous blocks.

*Web Project 1* (582-32W) is a prerequisite for this course, and this
course is a prerequisite for *Web Project 2* (582-41W).

## Modality

This course is conducted online synchronously. Zoom classroom links will
be provided on LEA. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is mandatory
for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are absent, it is
your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Outside of class periods, you can reach me through MIO at any time. On
weekdays, please allow 24 hours for me to respond.

## Pedagogical Approaches and Teaching Methods

Classes will consist of a blend of lectures, live coding sessions, and
exercises. It should not be necessary to take extensive notes during
class. Both lecture notes and examples will be provided through GitHub,
allowing you to concentrate on comprehending the subject matter. That
being said, you will frequently be encouraged to consult official
documentation.

## Required Material

No material is required for this class but a computer and an internet
connection. The reading material will be made freely available through
GitHub.

## Assessments

### Homework (30% / 9)

Assessments for this class are structured on a weekly basis. Every week,
dedicated class time will be allocated for the completion of a series of
short homework assignments directly tied to the learning material. Each
assignment within a given week builds upon the previous ones, ultimately
leading to the development of a more comprehensive project.

Homework assignments are meant to encourage continuous progress in
acquiring the course competencies. *Their content is not graded.*
Students who submit the assignment before next class will receive
a perfect grade.

### Projects (30% / 3)

Projects serve as the culmination of the homework assignments for a
particular week, and are designed to evaluate the understanding of the
learning material. As such, projects are graded based on the level of
proficiency students exhibit for the course competencies.

Note that projects should not pose a heavy workload for students who
complete their homework assignments on time.

### Learning Integration Assessment (40%)

> Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
> attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
> that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed.

The LIA for this course involves developing a small application of your
choice using Django, either individually or in pairs. While the specific
scope and features are at your discretion, the application must meet
criteria aligned with the learning material. The development will take
place during the final week of the course, with dedicated class time
provided for working on the application.

#### Evaluation Criteria

> -   Adequate understanding of the production specifications
> -   Proper installation and setup of the framework
> -   Appropriate use of the framework to handle HTTPS requests
> -   Appropriate use of the framework to process and display data
> -   Correct functioning of the completed product
> -   Proper application of testing

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well-written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues.

Accordingly, 10% of the total grade for projects and the LIA will be
devoted to the assessment of students' proficiency in the language of
instruction. Variable and function names will be assessed for
consistency and correctness, while comments will be assessed for
accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late Submission Policy

Homework submitted during or after the next class will not be accepted,
resulting in a score of 0.

For project submissions, including the LIA, no penalties will be applied
if prior arrangements were made with the teacher *before the submission
deadline*. However, if a project is submitted after the deadline without
prior arrangements, a deduction of 5% per day will be applied to the
best possible grade.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.
